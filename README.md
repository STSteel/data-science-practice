# data-science-practice
Learnings from my HarvardX Data Science modules, applied to a hypothesis that I am testing.

It is mostly used to help me explore R packages and libraries in practice and to get used to GitHub workflow.

It is organised in the following manner.
- Inputs: html, pdf, txt and other files used as raw data for the exercises. All these files are synthetic and created to test the hypothesis.
- Lib: R and knitr code
- Results: reports produced by knitr containing textual conclusions, data and graphs. Most of it is to practice the tools and technologies and not real validation of the hypothesis.

Hypothesis: There are linear relationships between the rate of decay of an information technology system and the following observed variables.
A. Number of executable components that can be deployed independently and are part of the target ecosystem
Then, for each component:
B. Number of current team members that have deployed the component over the previous 12 months
C. Time elapsed since previous build and/or deployment
D. Time elapsed since last update to knowledge repository (technical collaboration site for static or dynamic documentation and architectural diagrams)
E. Number of current team members that have addressed a support or service issue
F. Data volume processed (order of magnitude) per chosen unit of time 
G. Number of consumers of output (order of magnitude)
H. Number of operational risk items or audit issues registered and open.
